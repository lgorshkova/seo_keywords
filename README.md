# Seo keywords extraction

This is a prototype for extracting and ranking keywords from product listings (Amazon).

The system scrapes product titles, descriptions, and features, and applies two different keyword extraction approaches:

- **Semantic Keyword Ranking** using SBERT + TF-IDF + KeyBERT
- **Generative Keyword Suggestion** using OpenAI's GPT-3.5
