# Seo keywords extraction

This is a prototype for extracting and ranking keywords from product listings (Amazon).

The system scrapes product titles, descriptions, and features, and applies two different keyword extraction approaches:

- **Semantic Keyword Ranking** using SBERT + TF-IDF + KeyBERT
- **Generative Keyword Suggestion** using OpenAI's GPT-3.5

  Output(results) files :

| `input_products.json` | Raw product data scraped from Amazon, including titles, descriptions, and bullet points |
| `gpt_keywords.json` | Keywords generated by the GPT-3.5-based extractor |
| `ranked_keywords.json` | Final keyword ranking from the keywords_extractor.py|
